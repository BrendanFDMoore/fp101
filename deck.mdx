# Functional Programming
---
# What
- Paradigm based on first-class functions
- Supports functional _purity_
- Outcomes are deterministic
- Functions can be composed
- Follow a _declarative_ style, rather than _imperative_ (what, not how)

---
# Why
- Easier to test
- Easier to reason about outcomes
- Less complexity
- Ideally, less code
- Ultimately, because of the above, fewer bugs
---
# Pure Functions
What are some characteristics?
---
# Pure Functions
- Deterministic - they produce the same output for a given input
- Produce no side-effects
- Independent of context
---
# Pure Functions in EE
- Redux Reducers

# Referential Transparency
- Pure functions can be said to be _referentially transparent_
- Since their return value is the same for a given input, **they can be substituted for their return value**
- Allows for easier memoization, compiler optimization, etc.

# Referential Transparency
Why is purity important for this?

# First-Class Functions
Why do we mean by this?
---
# First-Class Functions
- They can be stored in a variable, object, or array
- They can be passed as an argument
- They can be returned from another function

# Higher-Order Functions

---
# Higher-Order Functions
- Take a function as input, or
- Return a function as output, or
- Both!

# HOC in EE

- `connect` from `react-redux`
- `FetchComponent`
- `createSelector` from `reselect`

# Arity
the number of arguments a function has

- Unary/1-ary: a function with *one* argument
- 2-ary: a function with *two* arguments
- N-ary: a function with _n_ arguments
---
# Partial Application
What is it?
---
# Partial Application
- Providing some, but not all, arguments
- Produce a new function with some arguments "built in"
- Allows us to "bind" some arguments and evaluate returned functions later
- Resulting function has lower arity (i.e., fewer arguments)
---

# Currying

- Convert N-ary functions into _N_ unary functions
- Allows for convenient partial application

    { lines: [9, 10], notes: 'and be evaluated later' },
    { lines: [6, 7], notes: 'Curried functions allow for "point-free" style' },
  ]}
/>
---
# Point-free
What's that?
---
# Point-free
### (aka Tacit Programming)
Omit unnecessary explicit arguments

- Smaller, cleaner code to read
- Less cognitive load
- More declarative (imposing args is imperative)

# Composition
Combining the effect of multiple functions together

- Helps us build up complexity from a number of small, simple steps
- Typically expressed as `f∘g(x) = f(g(x))`
- and pronounced as _"f of g of x"_
- Only First-Class Functions can be composed (Why?)

    { lines: [9, 10], notes: 'Because we expect to do this often' },
    { lines: [12, 13], notes: 'to simplify complex calculations' },
  ]}
/>
---
What about more than two functions composed together?
---
# Compose more!
We can just write a `compose` (or `pipe`) function for an arbitrary number of arguments!

# Immutability 
### TODO: clarify
- If you've noticed, in all of our examples so far, there have been no uses of `let`, or `var`
- In FP, nothing is variable; while `x` is in scope, it can never change
- FP favours immutability; the result of one function is passed to the input of another, onward until we end at our result
- State changes prevent referential transparency
- Reducers are pure functions
---
# Testing
- Pure, atomic functions are easily testable
- If we test small functions, we don't need to test complex composition
- We can infer the outcome will be as expected

# Thoughts
- These techniques can be used to reduce complex systems into a series of incredibly simple, testable steps
- Not a replacement for OOP or imperative techniques, they can all be used in unison
- This is just the beginning, FP is a deep and wide field of study
- javascript is well-suited for FP
---
# Caution
- As with all tools, FP can be misused
- It is entirely possible to create an over-curried mess
- Always keep an eye on the goal of readability and maintainability
- Since javascript allows multiple paradigms, _use when appropriate_

# Exercise
### Analyze some pet survey data

Go to: 
<br/>
<a href="https://codepen.io/BrendanFDMoore/pen/WYgwWL">https://codepen.io/BrendanFDMoore/pen/WYgwWL</a>
<br/>
and fork

We want to find the average age of all pet owners who are adults.

# Exercises to try later
- Write a general `reduce` function:

`const reduce = (reducer, initial, arr) => ???`

- Write `filter`, `map`, and `compose` (or `pipe`) using your own `reduce`
